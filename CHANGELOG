0.4.0
===============================================================================
* A brand new API, based on streaming. (The old API has been removed).
  Improvements due to the new API include:
** Reduced memory consumption, due to not having to load the entire file
   into memory. In practice, this allows the gem to read/write files that
   previously would have been prohibitively large.
** Better performance for large files, for the same reason as above.
** Ability to progressively append data to the end of a file, instead of
   writing the entire file at once.
** Ability to easily read and write data in an arbitrary format, regardless of
   the file's native format. For example, you can transparently read data out
   of a 16-bit stereo file as 8-bit mono.
** Automatic file management, similar to how IO.open() works.
* Ability to query format metadata of files without opening them, even for
  formats that this gem can't read or write.
* Support for reading and writing 32-bit PCM files.
* No longer supported: Reading PCM data as floating point and writing floating
  point as PCM.


0.3.0
===============================================================================
* New method bits_per_sample=(). Allows converting a file from 8-bit to 16-bit
  and vice-versa.
* New method num_channels=(). Allows converting a mono file to stereo, and
  vice-versa.
* New method sample_rate=(). Allows changing the sample rate of a file.
* New method duration(). Returns a hash listing the playback time of the file.
* New method inspect(). Returns a pretty-printed string listing metadata
  about the file.
* More descriptive error messages are displayed when a file with an invalid
  format can't be opened.
* Files that have more than just a format and data chunk can now be opened.


0.2.1
===============================================================================
* Fixed bug which prevented stereo files from being opened, due to refactoring
  gone bad.


0.2.0
===============================================================================
* Added support for properly reading and writing stereo files. Files with more
  than 2 channels (such as surround sound) are supported as well.
* Added convenience methods mono?() and stereo?().
* Can now pass :mono and :stereo into the num_channels argument of the
  constructor, to allow for more readable code.
* Added method reverse().
* Conversion of raw samples to normalized samples, and vice versa, is more
  accurate.


0.1.0
===============================================================================
* Initial version.
